# Automated validated example generation. Trustworth Synthetic Data

![Illustration of glowing cubes on an assmebly line](article_hero.png){.article-hero}

*Article 3 of the OOB Bench series.*

In article 2, we ended with vulnerabilites in 67 broad signature types. Each signature type had a descirption, vulerable code slice and a patch to fix it.
We have single examples for all 67 signature types. We have a sufficient number of pairs for less than 10 signature types. The majory have fewer than 5 pairs.
This kind of data imballance is exptected. Fortunatly there is a way to fix it with the use of a coding agent.

What makes a good vulnerability example
• Embodies the weakness in the same form as the original
• Looks like it came from a production codebase, ie not simplesitic, or too short, used custom data stuctures and language features like a normal code base would.  
• Doesn't have obvious tells that it's synthetic.
• Easy to compile run and instrament. 
• Can be validated algorythmetcally
• 
Fill sparse or imbalanced weakness classes with validated, atomic examples so an embedding model can learn true weakness semantics (not file names or style).
