Vartia is a small engineering practice focused on **machine learning systems and software development**.

We started Vartia to work on problems that tend to fall between traditional boundaries: where machine learning meets large, long-lived software systems, and where subtle failures can have outsized consequences. 
Much of our work involves understanding how systems behave under real conditions, rather than how they perform on paper.

Our background is rooted in **production software engineering** as much as in machine learning.
We’ve built and maintained complex systems across mobile, web, and embedded environments, and we approach ML with the same mindset: careful design, attention to failure modes, and skepticism of overly abstract metrics.

### Team

**Brian Williams**  
Brian is a machine learning engineer and software developer with more than two decades of experience building real-world systems.

He previously worked as a **Machine Learning Engineer at Apple**, where he contributed to multiple ML-driven projects inside large production environments. 
While much of that work is not public, it shaped a practical perspective on applied machine learning: 
models must integrate cleanly with software systems, operate under constraints, and be evaluated in ways that reflect how they will actually be used.

Earlier in his career, Brian worked as a senior software engineer and architect across a range of domains, including mobile platforms, computer vision, developer tools, and user-facing products. 
That background informs the current work at Vartia, which treats machine learning as one component of a broader engineering system, not an isolated artifact.
