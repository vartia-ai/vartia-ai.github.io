# House rules for Codex

- Keep the home “Latest Articles” layout ordered left → right as: thumbnail, body/title/summary, author/date meta. Thumbnail stays on the left; do not flip it to the right.
- When adjusting listing styles, target only `body.home .quarto-post.image-right` so article pages remain unaffected.
